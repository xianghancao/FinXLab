    "Geopolitical events, such as wars, sanctions, or policy shifts, can have significant and dynamic effects on financial markets. IRA helps quantify how a shock (e.g., an increase in geopolitical risk) impacts financial variables like stock returns, bond yields, exchange rates, or commodity prices over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Framework for Applying IRA:**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. **Define Variables:**\n",
    "   - Choose variables capturing the geopolitical events and financial markets. Examples:\n",
    "     - **Geopolitical Risk Index (GPR):** Proxy for geopolitical uncertainty.\n",
    "     - **Market Variables:** Stock market indices, exchange rates, commodity prices, or bond yields.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. **Data Collection:**\n",
    "   - Use high-frequency or monthly data depending on the scope of the study.\n",
    "   - Sources:\n",
    "     - GPR Index: Available from academic databases or creators like Caldara and Iacoviello.\n",
    "     - Financial market data: Bloomberg, Reuters, Yahoo Finance, or FRED.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. **Stationarity Testing:**\n",
    "   - Check if the time series are stationary using tests like Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) or KPSS.\n",
    "   - Transform non-stationary data (e.g., differencing or taking logs).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4. **Model Specification:**\n",
    "   - Fit a **Vector Autoregressive (VAR)** model to the variables.\n",
    "   - Use optimal lag selection criteria (e.g., AIC, BIC) for the VAR order.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 5. **Shock Identification:**\n",
    "   - Define shocks. For example:\n",
    "     - A sudden rise in the GPR index represents a geopolitical shock.\n",
    "     - Use **Cholesky decomposition** or **structural VAR (SVAR)** to identify meaningful shocks.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 6. **Impulse Response Analysis:**\n",
    "   - Generate Impulse Response Functions (IRFs) to visualize the effects of the shock on market variables.\n",
    "   - Examine the direction, magnitude, and duration of responses.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 7. **Variance Decomposition (Optional):**\n",
    "   - Quantify the contribution of geopolitical shocks to the variability of financial market variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Example Implementation in R:**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 1: Load Required Libraries\n",
    "```R\n",
    "install.packages(\"vars\")\n",
    "library(vars)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 2: Load or Simulate Data\n",
    "```R\n",
    "# Example: Simulating geopolitical risk and stock market returns\n",
    "set.seed(123)\n",
    "gpr <- cumsum(rnorm(100, mean = 0.2, sd = 1))  # Geopolitical Risk Index\n",
    "stock_returns <- cumsum(rnorm(100, mean = 0.1, sd = 1))  # Stock Market Returns\n",
    "data <- data.frame(gpr, stock_returns)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 3: Check Stationarity\n",
    "```R\n",
    "install.packages(\"tseries\")\n",
    "library(tseries)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Perform ADF test\n",
    "adf.test(data$gpr)\n",
    "adf.test(data$stock_returns)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Differencing if required\n",
    "data_diff <- diff(data)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 4: Fit VAR Model\n",
    "```R\n",
    "# Determine optimal lag length\n",
    "lag_selection <- VARselect(data_diff, lag.max = 10, type = \"const\")\n",
    "optimal_lag <- lag_selection$selection[\"AIC(n)\"]\n",
    "\n",
    "# Fit the VAR model\n",
    "var_model <- VAR(data_diff, p = optimal_lag, type = \"const\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 5: Conduct Impulse Response Analysis\n",
    "```R\n",
    "# Compute impulse response functions\n",
    "irf_results <- irf(var_model, impulse = \"gpr\", response = \"stock_returns\", \n",
    "                   n.ahead = 10, boot = TRUE)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Plot the IRF\n",
    "plot(irf_results)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 6: Variance Decomposition\n",
    "```R\n",
    "# Compute variance decomposition\n",
    "fevd_results <- fevd(var_model, n.ahead = 10)\n",
    "plot(fevd_results)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",

    "### **Interpretation of Results:**\n",
    "- **IRF Plot:**\n",
    "  - Shows how a sudden increase in geopolitical risk affects stock returns over time.\n",
    "  - The response may initially be negative (e.g., market sell-offs due to uncertainty) but could stabilize or reverse as the market adapts.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Variance Decomposition:**\n",
    "  - Quantifies how much of the stock return variability is explained by geopolitical risks compared to other factors.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Insights Gained:**\n",
    "1. **Risk Transmission:**\n",
    "   - How geopolitical shocks propagate through financial systems.\n",
    "2. **Market Sensitivity:**\n",
    "   - Which markets or asset classes are most vulnerable to geopolitical events.\n",
    "3. **Policy Implications:**\n",
    "   - Guides governments and investors in understanding the systemic impacts of political instability.\n",
