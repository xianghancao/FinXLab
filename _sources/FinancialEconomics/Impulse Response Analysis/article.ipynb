    "### **Cholesky Decomposition in Impulse Response Analysis**\n",
    "\n",
    "Cholesky decomposition is a common method for identifying shocks in a **Vector Autoregressive (VAR)** model when conducting Impulse Response Analysis (IRA). It helps disentangle the effects of individual variables in a multivariate system by imposing a structure on the error covariance matrix.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Purpose of Cholesky Decomposition in IRA**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Shock Identification:**\n",
    "   - Variables in a VAR model are correlated, and their error terms often exhibit contemporaneous relationships.\n",
    "   - Cholesky decomposition imposes an ordering on variables to identify \"structural\" shocks from the reduced-form VAR residuals.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Orthogonalization:**\n",
    "   - Ensures that shocks to each variable are uncorrelated with shocks to other variables, making the impulse responses interpretable.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **How It Works:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Error Covariance Matrix (Î£):**\n",
    "   - The residuals from a VAR model have a covariance matrix, \\( \\Sigma \\), which reflects the interdependence of variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Decomposition:**\n",
    "   - Cholesky decomposition factorizes \\( \\Sigma \\) as:\n",
    "     \\[\n",
    "     \\Sigma = PP'\n",
    "     \\]\n",
    "     where \\( P \\) is a lower triangular matrix.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Variable Ordering:**\n",
    "   - The ordering of variables determines the contemporaneous causal structure.\n",
    "   - The first variable in the ordering affects all subsequent variables contemporaneously, but not vice versa.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Advantages and Limitations of Cholesky Decomposition**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Advantages:**\n",
    "- Easy to implement.\n",
    "- Provides orthogonal shocks, simplifying interpretation.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Limitations:**\n",
    "- Strong dependence on variable ordering. A common strategy is to base the order on theoretical insights or causal intuition.\n",
    "- May not capture true causal relationships if ordering assumptions are incorrect.\n"
