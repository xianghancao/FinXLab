    "A Structural Vector Autoregression (SVAR) model is an extension of the traditional Vector Autoregression (VAR) model that incorporates **theoretical or structural restrictions** to identify specific, interpretable economic or financial shocks. Unlike the basic VAR, which provides reduced-form relationships, SVAR explicitly identifies and disentangles **causal mechanisms** in a system of interrelated variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Purpose of SVAR**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Identifying Structural Shocks:**\n",
    "   - Structural shocks are specific disturbances (e.g., monetary policy changes, geopolitical events) that are assumed to be orthogonal (uncorrelated) and interpretable.\n",
    "   - SVAR helps isolate the impact of these shocks on the system.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Relaxing Cholesky Limitations:**\n",
    "   - The Cholesky decomposition used in basic VAR assumes a particular ordering of variables, which may not align with theory. SVAR overcomes this limitation by imposing meaningful restrictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Economic Interpretability:**\n",
    "   - SVAR ensures that impulse response functions (IRFs) and forecast error variance decompositions (FEVDs) align with economic theory or domain-specific knowledge.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Theoretical Framework**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **1. Reduced-Form VAR**\n",
    "The reduced-form VAR is expressed as:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "Y_t = A_1 Y_{t-1} + \\ldots + A_p Y_{t-p} + u_t\n",
    "$$\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "- $ Y_t $: Vector of endogenous variables.\n",
    "- $ A_1, \\ldots, A_p $: Coefficient matrices.\n",
    "- $ u_t $: Vector of reduced-form residuals (correlated shocks).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **2. Structural Form**\n",
    "The structural form of VAR introduces contemporaneous relationships between variables:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "B Y_t = B_1 Y_{t-1} + \\ldots + B_p Y_{t-p} + \\epsilon_t\n",
    "$$\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "- $ B $: Matrix of contemporaneous relationships.\n",
    "- $ \\epsilon_t $: Vector of structural shocks (assumed orthogonal).\n",
    "\n",
    "The relationship between reduced-form residuals ($ u_t $) and structural shocks ($ \\epsilon_t $) is:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "u_t = B^{-1} \\epsilon_t\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **3. Identification Problem**\n",
    "To identify $ \\epsilon_t $, additional restrictions on $ B $ are required because the number of free parameters in $ B $ exceeds the number of equations.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Identification Methods**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Zero Restrictions:**\n",
    "   - Some variables do not affect others contemporaneously.\n",
    "   - Example: Geopolitical risk may not be contemporaneously influenced by financial market returns.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Sign Restrictions:**\n",
    "   - Specify the expected direction of the impact of a shock.\n",
    "   - Example: A geopolitical shock increases risk premia and decreases stock prices.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Long-Run Restrictions:**\n",
    "   - Assume that certain shocks have no long-term effect on some variables.\n",
    "   - Example: A temporary monetary policy shock may not affect long-run GDP levels.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Short-Run Restrictions:**\n",
    "   - Constrain contemporaneous effects based on economic theory.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Application of SVAR**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Use Case: Geopolitical Events and Financial Markets**\n",
    "- Variables: Geopolitical Risk Index (GPR), stock returns, bond yields.\n",
    "- Goal: Identify and measure the impact of geopolitical shocks on financial markets.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Steps in Analysis**\n",
    "1. **Fit a Reduced-Form VAR Model:**\n",
    "   - Estimate the relationships among variables without imposing structural assumptions.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Apply Structural Restrictions:**\n",
    "   - Define the $ B $ matrix based on theory (e.g., GPR influences stock and bond markets contemporaneously, but not vice versa).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Conduct Impulse Response Analysis (IRA):**\n",
    "   - Measure the dynamic effects of a geopolitical shock on financial variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Perform Variance Decomposition:**\n",
    "   - Quantify the contribution of structural shocks to the variability of each variable.\n",
